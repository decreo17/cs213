            <h2 class="our-story">Our Story</h2>
            <p class="our-story">
                Jen and I both served as full-time missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
                in Philippines Bacolod Mission. We served on the same year, 2011 to 2013 but different months, 
                I started my service March 2011 and she started her service later that year. She went home around two months after I went home. 
                What's interesting about it? Though we served on the same year with the same mission president, we don't really meet 
                each other in the mission field. I just recognized her because one of her previous area was my last area, 
                that was San Carlos 2nd Branch at San Carlos District.
            </p>
            <p class="our-story">
                I was at the Philippines Manila Temple when they arrived in Manila, her mother was waiting there also and 
                I talked to her; at that time, I had no idea that she will be my mother-in-law. I joined the other returned full-time missionary
                that day to attend a temple session, but we've noticed that Jen and her family already went home so we don't really have
                time to talk.
            </p>
            <p class="our-story">
                Fast forward, months later I got a job a at a real estate company as marketing assistant. I was tasked
                to visit our church chapels in Dasmariñas to recruit for online marketer. I was not successful in recruiting people,
                but it seems like I was about to be recruited. At that time my best friend Jerik, then Elder Pelipel, was serving as
                a full-time missionary at that area, fortunately the last chapel that I visited was the very area where he is serving, 
                we have not seen each other for at least two years so we had some small talk, he then told me that there was a new
                returned missionary in that ward from Philippines Bacolod Mission. He then introduced Jennica to me. As I don't meet her
                at the mission field, I know little about her, but fortunately we have some common friends so we were able to have a
                small conversation. I don't even know that she had a boyfriend at that time. At one point, I saw her standing in front
                of the chapel, a question pops up in my mind, "<em>could she be my eternal companion?</em>". I didn’t know why I had that
                impression at that time, and I just ignore it.
            </p>
            <p class="our-story">
                I continued my visit in that area, sometimes for work and sometimes just to be with my best-friend, in one of my visits,
                Jerik had a meeting at that time and we thought that it would be long so Jen invited me to go out for a lunch. 
                I actually thought that we will go to their house but we end up going to a fast-food restaurant, 
                then boom, our first informal date happened. Since then, our communication continued until September 2013, 
                from me and her, there was <em>"us"</em>. Unfortunately, I spend more in my travel expense than what I am earning at 
                my current job then so I have to quit. This means that I will not be able to visit Jen and our relationship will 
                continue as long distance. I tried to find a new job but the start-up company that I joined turns out to be fraud 
                and the owners scammed politician and other members of our church.
                Fortunately, I was still able to receive some salary and was able to buy a ring for Jen. That was December 2013 at a park,
                I finally had the courage to officially ask her to marry me. I was jobless, she was too, so we don't really know how 
                we are going to fund our marriage and start a family. 
            </p>
            <p class="our-story">
                We may have no money at the time of my proposal, yet we have <strong>faith</strong>. The following year, a miracle happened. On January 2014
                Jennica was hired at a logistic company. I was also hired at my current job but officially started March 2014, 
                our target marriage date was May 2014, so it was just two months' salary for me to fund our marriage. 
                We were so blessed to have friends and supportive family members, through their donation and service, 
                we were married in the Philippines Manila Temple on May 2014 and the rest was history.
            </p>
            <p class="our-story">
                Today, seven years later, Jen is a full-time mom and we are blessed to have our daughter Kwin(K-win), she was born last
                year during the pandemic and 6 years after our marriage. I am still working and continuing my study and this page
                was part of my assignment. Our married life was tested many times and still not perfect,
                but I'm grateful that we had made that decission and we learn a lot from it. I testify that marriage 
                indeed is ordained of God and central to His plan. We have been tried and blessed because of our decission to marry.
                I also encourage young single adult to take the same decission to be married and stay in the covenant path.
